The idea is to have a Excel/CSV file whereIn your stockName,EntryPrice,Target,SL,Quantity would be mentioned.
This script will be like a daemon/cron-job to regularly check for updates and place buy/sell order automatically without user intervention thereby giving freedom to user to continue working on his/her stuff ( or sleep zzzZZZZ )
